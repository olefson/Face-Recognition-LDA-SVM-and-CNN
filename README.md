# Face-Recognition-LDA-SVM-and-CNN
This project aims to compare the performance of three different machine learning models—LDA, SVM, and CNN—for face recognition tasks. Using the Olivetti faces dataset, which consists of 400 64x64 images from 40 different subjects, the goal is to identify the subject of a given face image.
